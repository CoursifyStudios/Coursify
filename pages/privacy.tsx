				In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or

			<p>
				Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy

			<p>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</p>
			<p>We do not process consumer&#39;s sensitive personal information.</p>
			<p>Verification process</p>
			<p>
				Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
				determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
				our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
				information so that we can match it with information you have previously
				provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
				we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
				information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
				we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email)
				that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
				verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
				your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
				we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
				purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
				from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
				provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
				identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
				such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
				you.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your
