				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

				<br />
				ownership of such entity.
			</p>

			<p>
				2. License Grants and Conditions
				<br />
				--------------------------------
			</p>

			<p>2.1. Grants</p>

			<p>
				Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
				<br />
				non-exclusive license:
			</p>

			<p>
				(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
				<br />
				Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
				<br />
				modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
				<br />
				Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
				<br />
				as part of a Larger Work; and
			</p>

			<p>
				(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
				<br />
				for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
				<br />
				Contributions or its Contributor Version.
			</p>

			<p>2.2. Effective Date</p>

			<p>
				The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
				<br />
				become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
				<br />
				distributes such Contribution.
			</p>

			<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>

			<p>
				The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
				<br />
				this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
				<br />
				distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
				<br />
				Contributor:
			</p>

			<p>
				(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
				<br />
				or
			</p>

			<p>
				(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third
				party&apos;s
				<br />
				modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
				<br />
				Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
				<br />
				Version); or
			</p>

			<p>
				(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
				<br />
				its Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
				<br />
				or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
				<br />
				the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
			</p>

			<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>

			<p>
				No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
				<br />
				distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
				<br />
				License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
				<br />
				permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
			</p>

			<p>2.5. Representation</p>

			<p>
				Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
				<br />
				Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
				<br />
				to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
			</p>

			<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>

			<p>
				This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
				<br />
				applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
				<br />
				equivalents.
			</p>

			<p>2.7. Conditions</p>

			<p>
				Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
				<br />
				in Section 2.1.
			</p>

			<p>
				3. Responsibilities
				<br />
				-------------------
			</p>

			<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>

			<p>
				All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
				<br />
				Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
				<br />
				the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
				<br />
				Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
				<br />
				License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
				<br />
				attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&apos; rights in the Source
				Code
				<br />
				Form.
			</p>

			<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>

			<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

			<p>
				(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
				<br />
				Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
				<br />
				the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
				<br />
				Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
				<br />
				than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
			</p>

			<p>
				(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
				<br />
				License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
				<br />
				license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
				<br />
				the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
			</p>

			<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>

			<p>
				You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
				<br />
				provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
				<br />
				the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
				<br />
				Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
				<br />
				Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
				<br />
				License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
				<br />
				under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
				<br />
				the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
				<br />
				Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
				<br />
				License(s).
			</p>

			<p>3.4. Notices</p>

			<p>
				You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
				<br />
				(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
				<br />
				or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
				<br />
				the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
				<br />
				the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
			</p>

			<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>

			<p>
				You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
				<br />
				indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
				<br />
				Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
				<br />
				behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
				<br />
				such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
				<br />
				You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
				<br />
				liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
				<br />
				indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
				<br />
				disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
				<br />
				jurisdiction.
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
				<br />
				---------------------------------------------------
			</p>

			<p>
				If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
				<br />
				License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
				<br />
				statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
				<br />
				the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
				<br />
				describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
				<br />
				be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
				<br />
				Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
				<br />
				or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
				<br />
				recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Termination
				<br />
				--------------
			</p>

			<p>
				5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
				<br />
				if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
				<br />
				compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
				<br />
				Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
				<br />
				Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
				<br />
				ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
				<br />
				non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
				<br />
				come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
				<br />
				Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
				<br />
				notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
				<br />
				first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
				<br />
				from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
				<br />
				Your receipt of the notice.
			</p>

			<p>
				5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
				<br />
				infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
				<br />
				counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
				<br />
				directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
				<br />
				You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
				<br />
				2.1 of this License shall terminate.
			</p>

			<p>
				5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
				<br />
				end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
				<br />
				have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
				<br />
				prior to termination shall survive termination.
			</p>

			<p>

				<br />
				* *<br />
				* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty *<br />
				* ------------------------- *<br />
				* *<br />
				* Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as
				is&quot; *<br />
				* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *
				<br />
				* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *<br />
				* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *<br />
				* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the *
				<br />
				* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *<br />
				* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *
				<br />
				* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *
				<br />
				* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *
				<br />
				* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
				<br />
				* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. *<br />
				* *<br />
				************************************************************************
			</p>

			<p>
				************************************************************************
				<br />
				* *<br />
				* 7. Limitation of Liability *<br />
				* -------------------------- *<br />
				* *<br />
				* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *<br />
				* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *<br />
				* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *<br />
				* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *<br />
				* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *<br />
				* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *
				<br />
				* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *
				<br />
				* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party *<br />
				* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *
				<br />
				* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *
				<br />
				* personal injury resulting from such party&apos;s negligence to the *
				<br />
				* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *<br />
				* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *<br />
				* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *<br />
				* limitation may not apply to You. *<br />
				* *<br />
				************************************************************************
			</p>

			<p>
				8. Litigation
				<br />
				-------------
			</p>

			<p>
				Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
				<br />
				courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
				<br />
				place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
				<br />
				jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
				<br />
				Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&apos;s ability to bring
				<br />
				cross-claims or counter-claims.
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Miscellaneous
				<br />
				----------------
			</p>

			<p>
				This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
				<br />
				matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
				<br />
				unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
				<br />
				necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
				<br />
				that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
				<br />
				shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
			</p>

			<p>
				10. Versions of the License
				<br />
				---------------------------
			</p>

			<p>10.1. New Versions</p>

			<p>
				Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
				<br />
				10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
				<br />
				publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br />
				distinguishing version number.
			</p>

			<p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>

			<p>
				You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
				<br />
				of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
				<br />
				or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
				<br />
				steward.
			</p>

			<p>10.3. Modified Versions</p>

			<p>
				If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
				<br />
				create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br />
				modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
				<br />
				any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
				<br />
				such modified license differs from this License).
			</p>

			<p>
				10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
				<br />
				Licenses
			</p>

			<p>
				If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
				<br />
				Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
				<br />
				notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
			</p>

			<p>

				<br />
				for such a notice.

			</p>

			<p>
				A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
				<br />
				==========================
			</p>

			<p>
				Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
				<br />
				Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
				<br />
				as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python&apos;s
				<br />
				principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
				<br />
				National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
				<br />
				in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
				<br />
				software.
			</p>

			<p>
				In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
				<br />
				BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same
				<br />
				year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
				<br />
				Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
				<br />
				https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
				<br />
				created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
				<br />
				Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
			</p>

			<p>
				All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
				<br />
				the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python
				<br />
				releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
				<br />
				the various releases.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Release Derived Year Owner GPL-
				<br />
				from compatible? (1)
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes
				<br />
				1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes
				<br />
				1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no
				<br />
				2.0 1.6 2000 BeOpen.com no
				<br />
				1.6.1 1.6 2001 CNRI yes (2)
				<br />
				2.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF no
				<br />
				2.0.1 2.0+1.6.1 2001 PSF yes
				<br />
				2.1.1 2.1+2.0.1 2001 PSF yes
				<br />
				2.1.2 2.1.1 2002 PSF yes
				<br />
				2.1.3 2.1.2 2002 PSF yes
				<br />
				2.2 and above 2.1.1 2001-now PSF yes
			</p>

			<p>Footnotes:</p>

			<p>
				(1) GPL-compatible doesn&apos;t mean that we&apos;re distributing Python
				under
				<br />
				the GPL. All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
				<br />
				a modified version without making your changes open source. The
				<br />
				GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
				<br />
				other software that is released under the GPL; the others don&apos;t.
			</p>

			<p>
				(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
				<br />
				because its license has a choice of law clause. According to
				<br />
				CNRI, however, Stallman&apos;s lawyer has told CNRI&apos;s lawyer that
				1.6.1
				<br />
				is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido&apos;s
				<br />
				direction to make these releases possible.
			</p>

				(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
			</p>

			<p>
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				<br />
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
				<br />

				the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
				<br />
				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:

				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under

				<br />
				the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
			</p>

			<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to

				distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
				<br />
				License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
				<br />
				permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
			</p>

			<p>2.5. Representation</p>

				<br />
				grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

			<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under

			<p>2.7. Conditions</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

				<br />
				Section 2.1.
			</p>

			<p>3. Responsibilities</p>

			<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
				<br />
				Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
				<br />
				the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
				<br />
				Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
				<br />
				License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
				<br />
				attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&apos; rights in the Source
				Code
				<br />
				Form.
			</p>

			<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>

			<p> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
				Form,
				<br />
				as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
				<br />
				Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
				<br />
				reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
				<br />
				of distribution to the recipient; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
				<br />
				License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
				<br />
				license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
				<br />
				recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
			</p>

			<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
				<br />
				provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
				<br />
				the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
				<br />
				Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
				<br />
				Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
				<br />
				License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
				<br />
				under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
				<br />
				the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
				<br />
				Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
				<br />
				License(s).
			</p>

			<p>3.4. Notices</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
				<br />
				(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
				or
				<br />
				limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
				<br />
				Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
				<br />
				extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
			</p>

			<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
				<br />
				indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
				<br />
				Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
				<br />
				behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
				<br />
				such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
				<br />
				You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
				<br />
				liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
				<br />
				indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
				<br />
				disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
				<br />
				jurisdiction.
			</p>

			<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
				License
				<br />
				with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
				<br />
				judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
				of
				<br />
				this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
				<br />
				limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in
				a<br />
				text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
				<br />
				this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
				<br />
				such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
				ordinary
				<br />
				skill to be able to understand it.
			</p>

			<p>5. Termination</p>

			<p>
				5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
				if You
				<br />
				fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
				<br />
				then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
				<br />
				are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
				<br />
				explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
				<br />
				basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
				<br />
				some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
				<br />
				compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
				<br />
				reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
				<br />
				non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
				<br />
				received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
				<br />
				Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
				receipt
				<br />
				of the notice.
			</p>

			<p>
				5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
				<br />
				infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
				<br />
				counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
				<br />
				directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
				<br />
				You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
				<br />
				2.1 of this License shall terminate.
			</p>

			<p>
				5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
				end user
				<br />
				license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
				been
				<br />
				validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
				<br />
				termination shall survive termination.
			</p>

			<p>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;
				basis,
				<br />
				without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
				<br />
				including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
				free
				<br />
				of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
				non-infringing.
				<br />
				The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered
				Software
				<br />
				is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
				<br />
				You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
				<br />
				repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
				essential
				<br />
				part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under
				<br />
				this License except under this disclaimer.
			</p>

			<p>7. Limitation of Liability</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
				(including
				<br />
				negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone
				who
				<br />
				distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for
				any
				<br />
				direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
				<br />
				character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss
				of
				<br />
				goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
				<br />
				informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
				liability
				<br />
				shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
				<br />
				such party&apos;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
				<br />
				limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation
				of
				<br />
				incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
				may
				<br />
				not apply to You.
			</p>

			<p>8. Litigation</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
				courts
				<br />
				of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
				<br />
				business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
				<br />
				jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
				Nothing
				<br />
				in this Section shall prevent a party&apos;s ability to bring
				cross-claims or
				<br />
				counter-claims.
			</p>

			<p>9. Miscellaneous</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
				<br />
				matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
				<br />
				unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
				<br />
				necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
				that
				<br />
				the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
				not
				<br />
				be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
			</p>

			<p>10. Versions of the License</p>

			<p>10.1. New Versions</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
				<br />
				10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
				<br />
				publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br />
				distinguishing version number.
			</p>

			<p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
				<br />
				of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
				<br />
				or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
				<br />
				steward.
			</p>

			<p>10.3. Modified Versions</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
				<br />
				create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br />
				modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
				<br />
				any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
				<br />
				such modified license differs from this License).
			</p>

			<p>
				10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
				<br />
				Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is
				<br />
				Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of
				<br />
				the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be
				<br />
				attached.

				<br />
				direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
				<br />
				otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

				Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br />
				copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
				<br />
				(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				<br />
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
				<br />
				the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
				<br />
				to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
				<br />
				submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
				<br />
				or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
				<br />
				the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

				<br />
				means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
				<br />
				to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
				<br />

				Contribution.&quot;
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}

				{" "}
				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>

			<p>
				Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
				<br />
				conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
				<br />
				original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
				<br />
				and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
				<br />
				following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
				<br />
				exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
				<br />
				intended for use by those authorized to give the public
				<br />
				permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
				<br />
				copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
				<br />
				irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
				<br />
				and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
				<br />
				Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
				<br />
				applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
				<br />
				material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
				<br />
				material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
				<br />
				licensed material, or material used under an exception or
				<br />
				limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
				<br />
				wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
				<br />
				licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
				<br />
				licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
				<br />
				the licensor&apos;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
				<br />
				example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
				<br />
				copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
				<br />
				licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
				<br />
				other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
				<br />
				the licensed material may still be restricted for other
				<br />
				reasons, including because others have copyright or other
				<br />
				rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
				<br />
				such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
				<br />
				Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
				<br />
				respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
				<br />

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
				<br />
				under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
			</p>

			<p>Section 2 -- Scope.</p>

			<p> a. License grant.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
				<br />
				the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
				<br />
				non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
				<br />
				exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
				<br />
				in part; and
			</p>

			<p> b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
				<br />
				Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
				<br />
				License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
				<br />
				its terms and conditions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
				<br />
				6(a).
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
				<br />
				Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
				<br />
				all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
				<br />
				and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
				<br />
				Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
				<br />
				authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
				<br />
				necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
				<br />
				technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
				<br />
				Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
				<br />
				simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
				<br />
				(4) never produces Adapted Material.
			</p>

			<p> 5. Downstream recipients.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
				<br />
				recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
				<br />
				receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
				<br />
				Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
				<br />
				Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
				<br />
				any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
				<br />
				apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
				<br />
				Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
				<br />
				Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
				<br />
				Material.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
				<br />
				may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
				<br />
				are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
				<br />
				with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
				<br />
				the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
				<br />
				provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
			</p>

			<p> b. Other rights.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
				<br />
				licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
				<br />
				privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
				<br />
				the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
				<br />
				assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
				<br />
				extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
				<br />
				Rights, but not otherwise.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
				<br />
				Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
				<br />
				collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
				<br />
				Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
				<br />
				under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
				<br />
				licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
				<br />
				reserves any right to collect such royalties.
			</p>

			<p>Section 3 -- License Conditions.</p>

			<p>
				Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
				<br />
				following conditions.
			</p>

			<p> a. Attribution.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
				<br />
				form), You must:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
				<br />
				with the Licensed Material:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
				<br />
				Material and any others designated to receive
				<br />
				attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
				<br />
				the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
				<br />
				designated);
			</p>

			<p> ii. a copyright notice;</p>

			<p> iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
				<br />
				warranties;
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
				<br />
				extent reasonably practicable;
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
				<br />
				retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
				<br />
				Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
				<br />
				hyperlink to, this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
				<br />
				reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
				<br />
				which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
				<br />
				reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
				<br />
				hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
				<br />
				information.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
				<br />
				information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
				<br />
				reasonably practicable.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&apos;s
				<br />
				License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
				<br />
				Material from complying with this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.</p>

			<p>
				Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
				<br />
				apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
				<br />
				to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
				<br />
				portion of the contents of the database;
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
				<br />
				contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
				<br />
				Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
				<br />
				Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
				<br />
				all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
				<br />
				replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
				<br />
				Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
			</p>

			<p>Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
				<br />
				EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
				<br />
				AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
				<br />
				ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
				<br />
				IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
				<br />
				WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
				<br />
				PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
				<br />
				ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
				<br />
				KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
				<br />
				ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
				<br />
				TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
				<br />
				NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
				<br />
				INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
				<br />
				COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
				<br />
				USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
				<br />
				ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
				<br />
				DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
				<br />
				IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
				<br />
				above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
				<br />
				possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
				<br />
				waiver of all liability.
			</p>

			<p>Section 6 -- Term and Termination.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
				<br />
				Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
				<br />
				this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
				<br />
				terminate automatically.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
				<br />
				Section 6(a), it reinstates:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
				<br />
				it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
				<br />
				violation; or
			</p>

			<p> 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
				<br />
				right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
				<br />
				of this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
				<br />
				Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
				<br />
				distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
				<br />
				will not terminate this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
				<br />
				License.
			</p>

			<p>Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
				<br />
				terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
				<br />
				Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
				<br />
				independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>Section 8 -- Interpretation.</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
				<br />
				shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
				<br />
				conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
				<br />
				be made without permission under this Public License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
				<br />
				deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
				<br />
				minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
				<br />
				cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
				<br />
				without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
				<br />
				conditions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
				<br />
				failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
				<br />
				Licensor.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
				<br />
				as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
				<br />
				that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
				<br />
				processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or

				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />

				meet the following conditions:

				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

				(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				<br />
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
				<br />
				the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
				<br />
				to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
				<br />
				submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or

				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

			<p>
				{" "}

				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its

				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or

				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

				meet the following conditions:

				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or

				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />

				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:

				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
				<br />
				Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br />
				copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
				<br />
				(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				<br />
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
				<br />
				the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
				<br />
				to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
				<br />
				submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
				<br />
				or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
				<br />
				the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,

				<br />
				means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
				<br />
				to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
				<br />
				communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

				Contribution.&quot;
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
				Entity
				<br />

			<p>
				{" "}
				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				<br />
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
				<br />
				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
			</p>

			<p> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

				below).
			</p>

			<p>
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object form, that
				<br />
				is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
				revisions,
				<br />
				annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole,
				an
				<br />
				original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
				Derivative Works
				<br />
				shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or
				bind by
				<br />
				name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
				the original version
				<br />
				of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or

			<p>2. Grant of Copyright License.</p>

			<p>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
				hereby
				<br />
				grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
				royalty-free,
				<br />
				irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work
				and such
				<br />
				Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>

			<p>3. Grant of Patent License.</p>

			<p>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
				hereby
				<br />
				grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
				royalty-free,
				<br />
				irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
				have
				<br />
				made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				where
				<br />
				such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
				Contributor
				<br />
				that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
				combination
				<br />
				of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
				<br />
				submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
				(including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
				<br />
				Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
				contributory
				<br />
				patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
				License
				<br />
				for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>4. Redistribution.</p>

			<p>
				You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
				thereof
				<br />
				in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
				form,
				<br />
				provided that You meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
				copy of
				<br />
				this License; and
				<br />
				You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
				that You
				<br />
				changed the files; and
				<br />
				You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
				distribute,
				<br />
				all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
				Source form
				<br />
				of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				the
				<br />
				Derivative Works; and
				<br />
				If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				distribution, then any
				<br />
				Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
				<br />
				attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
				notices
				<br />
				that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				of the
				<br />
				following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
				<br />
				Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
				along
				<br />
				with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
				Derivative
				<br />
				Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
				contents of
				<br />
				the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify
				the
				<br />
				License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
				Works that
				<br />
				You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
				Work,
				<br />
				provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
				<br />
				modifying the License.
				<br />
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
				provide
				<br />
				additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
				reproduction, or
				<br />
				distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as
				a whole,
				<br />
				provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
				complies
				<br />
				with the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>5. Submission of Contributions.</p>

			<p>
				Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
				submitted
				<br />
				for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
				terms and
				<br />
				conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the
				terms of
				<br />
				any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
				regarding
				<br />
				such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>6. Trademarks.</p>

			<p>
				This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
				trademarks,
				<br />
				service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
				<br />
				reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
				<br />
				reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>

			<p>
				Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
				provides the
				<br />
				Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS
				IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
				<br />
				including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
				<br />
				NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
				You are
				<br />
				solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
				<br />
				redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
				exercise of
				<br />
				permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>8. Limitation of Liability.</p>

			<p>
				In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
				negligence),
				<br />
				contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
				deliberate
				<br />
				and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
				Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				incidental,
				<br />
				or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
				License or
				<br />
				out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited
				to
				<br />
				damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
				malfunction, or
				<br />
				any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
				Contributor has
				<br />
				been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</p>

			<p>
				While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
				choose to
				<br />
				offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				or
				<br />
				other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
				However,
				<br />
				in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
				on Your
				<br />
				sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if
				You
				<br />
				agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
				liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of
				your
				<br />
				accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or
				Object
				<br />
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				<br />
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				<br />
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				<br />
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				<br />
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				&quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including

				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				<br />
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				<br />
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

				{" "}

				<br />
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				<br />
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				<br />
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				<br />
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				<br />
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				<br />
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				<br />
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br />
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

			</p>

			<p>
				If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
				a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
				file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
				Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
				NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the

				Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
				NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
				License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
				Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
				text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
				cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own
				copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
				different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
				distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as
				a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work

				to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
				its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
				CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
				limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
				MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely

				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
				required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
				acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
				for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
				consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
				License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
				not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
				failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
				losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
				such damages.

				Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
				fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
				obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
				accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
				Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and

				liability.

				copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or

			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
				You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this

			</p>

			<p>
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed

				limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
				required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
				acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
				for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
				consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
				License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
				not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
				failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
				losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
				such damages.

				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the

				obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
				accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
				Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
				only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
				harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
				Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
				liability.

				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				<br />
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				<br />
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				<br />
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				<br />
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				<br />
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				<br />
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				<br />
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				<br />
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				<br />
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				<br />
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				<br />
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				<br />
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				<br />
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
				<br />
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				<br />
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				<br />
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				<br />
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				<br />
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				<br />
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				<br />
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				<br />
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				<br />
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				<br />
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				<br />
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				<br />
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				<br />
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				<br />
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				<br />
				as modifying the License.
			</p>

			<p>
				{" "}
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				<br />
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				<br />
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				<br />
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				<br />
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				<br />
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				<br />
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				<br />
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				<br />
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				<br />
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				<br />
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				<br />
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				<br />
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				<br />
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				<br />
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>

			<p>
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				<br />
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				<br />
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
				<br />
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				<br />
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				<br />
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br />
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				<br />
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				<br />
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>

			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				<br />
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				<br />
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				<br />
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				<br />
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				<br />
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br />
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				<br />
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				<br />
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				<br />
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				<br />
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>

			<p>
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				<br />
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				<br />
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				<br />
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				<br />
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				<br />
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				<br />
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				<br />
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				<br />
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				<br />
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
